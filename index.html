      <h2>Hand-coded, One Scoop at a Time</h2>
      <p>
        At Swirl, we celebrate creativity, coding, and cold desserts! Made with help of HackClub,
        this site is our sweet little scoop of Hacking. Every page was written by hand, like your favorite handwritten recipe card.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're like us - learning to code and craving something cool - you're in the right place.
