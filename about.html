            <p>Swirl Ice Cream isn't a real dessert shop - its's a real coding project!
                The goal? Brush up some HTML and CSS skills by building something fun, colorful and a little bit silly.
            </p>
            <p><a href="hackclub.com">We</a> believe learning is best with a scoof of fun. If you're a teenager like me, keep coding, keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - just like making ice cream, it's all about the mix.</p>
